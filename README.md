Movie App: 

Built an application that pulls data from the imdB public API. The user can search through the data, and add to various watchlist/favorites. The user can then delete from these lists as they see fit. Basic crud. 

Built with React and imdb api. 

Struggles with keeping track of props/state led me further investigate the uses of useReducer/Context Api hooks.
