# Movie App: # 

 > Built an application that pulls data from the imdB public API. The user can search through the data, and add to various watchlist/favorites. The user can then delete from these lists as they see fit. Successfully implemented basic crud functionality. 

> Built with React and imdb api. To develop this project, I would like to develop a feature that allows for the creation of users(the users could share their favorites amongst one another). A simple social media prototype. I could use different storage systems for this, perhaps firebase or MongoDb. Storage now is super simple with local storage. This is bad for UX because the UI is loaded with a blank page at users first interaction. SO JUST ADD SOME DATA TO SEE HOW IT WORKS. PRESS ADD at top right and go ahead and search your favorites (LIKE DEXTER) 

> Struggles with keeping track of props/state led me further investigate the uses of useReducer/Context Api hooks.
